# Circa Survivor Projection Model

Objective: Try to more accurately predict Circa Survivor contestant selections which have proven to be difficult to accurately project versus public resources such as SurvivorGrid.

## Theory

The following is a list of items I need to consider when building a selection projection model -
- Remaining pool size
- What week we are in (early weeks vs late weeks)
- "Candidate Selections" - much like in chess where you evaluate candidate moves, identify candidate selections and depth of candidate selections in a particular week and the depth's relationship to distribution
