 # Network Building

## Geography

General idea about building the ideal network is coverage, coverage, coverage. What does coverage mean (American centric)? You're going to want access to legals, bonuses, kiosks, PPHs, offshores, etc. - i.e. ability to access as many markets as possible for pricing and liquidity reasons. Now, there will be a tradeoff for coverage with accessible bankroll/capital and ability to constantly churn over that bankroll, but, in a vacuum, more outs, more liquidity the better.<br /><br />

What exactly determines the geographical boundaries that you must occupy?
- Online Sportsbooks
- Brick & Mortar / Cash & Counter Locations
- Standalone Kiosks
- Geolocation and Governmental and Financial Restrictions

Therefore, the best approach is to identify exactly what the optimal location would be to find runners.
- List of Online Sportsbooks - (to be published later)
- List of Brick & Mortar locations - n/a
- List of Cash & Counter locations -

Once you have a comprehensive idea of all the physical and digital locations you need access to successfully build out a full coverage network, you then need to tackle the following problems - 
- Staffing & Vetting
- Financing
- Reconciliation
- Communications
- OpSec
- KPIs / Telemetry

## Staffing & Vetting

Make no mistake - the sports betting landscape is a cesspool. Anyone who says different cannot be trusted to be able to give you an accurate interpretation about the world around them. A very common theme you hear in the sports betting world is the situation where someone gets stiffed and, only after they get stiffed, do they start to perform the required fact finding to try and ensure they get paid. Obviously, this is backwards and we want to build out our network and perform all vetting before anything distressing happens.

So, where do you start?

It starts with realistic expectations. No matter how much vetting you do, you will get stiffed. You will get ghosted. You will have to chase down money. You will have to sometimes push an issue far enough to become enough of an issue to the "problem network member" that you get moved to the front of the creditor line. You should expect all of these things to happen to you at some point, the goal is to limit the occurrences. What's a good list of things to accomplish before entering into some networking agreement / partnership -
- Identify person's digital footprint
- Identify person's physical world footprint
- Tie digital identity to their physical identity
- Reputation / Background check

Let's start with the digital identity portion and those network connections that you make online.

### Information Gathering (in progress)

During the information gathering process, you want to perform two separate, but connected processes - identification and archival. First, depending on how you were introduced to this connection, you're going to obtain "initial point of contact" information from this person. This will vary by introduction method so the concept here is to fill in whatever blanks are remaining before proceeding in earnest.
- Real name
- Physical location
- Employer if applicable
- Phone numbers
- Social media accounts

The first 4 are self-explanatory. Again, you don't want to go searching for this info, as we see often in the various "stiffs" channels, after the fact - you want to have all this information already accessible before anything happens. Let's instead focus on the digital presence.

- Social media archival
- Network graph building

### Financing

Properly financing your network requires acute attention to the following areas - 
- Bankroll size needed whether cash or credit
- Capital Efficiency
- Fiat vs Crypto & methods of settlement
- Tax considerations

### Reconciliation

Probably one of the underdiscussed issues in networking is the reconciliation needed to conduct and finalize business agreements. Reconciliation has to consider the following issues - 
- Jurisdictional issues including taxes
- Transfer fees
- Method of reconciliation (paper fiat vs digital fiat vs crypto vs other) which is slightly different than the financing piece because you can limit the methods inside your network, but reconciliation might require settling in other methods based on counterparties.
- Dispute resolution

### Communications

In the world of sports betting networking, your communication platform acts not only as method of communication, but also as an informal record / set of contracts. Therefore, when choosing a communications platform, you want to account for the following - 
- Can the messages be edited? Version control?
- Can the messages be deleted?
- Do you need ephemeral messaging for any reason?
- Ease of use
- Extendability through programmatic solutions



### OpSec

OpSec, short for Operational Security, is simply defined as - <i>"a process that identifies critical information to determine whether friendly actions can be observed by enemy intelligence, determines if information obtained by adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly critical information"</i>. When it comes to operating a sports betting network, you will definitely want to make OpSec one of your primary concerns so that other groups, sportsbooks, other bettors, etc cannot take your critical information and use it to their advantage or, even worse, against you.<br /><br />
Whether you know it or not, you're engaging in "Information Warfare" which I cover in depth here. (link to Medium article when complete)<br /><br />
Your OpSec procedures will be determined by who your adversary - i.e. "who are you actually trying to hide from?". If you're trying to hide information from a sportsbook, that's one set of procedures. Hide information from other bettors and screen watchers, that's another. Low level employees with database/backend access? That's another. From the government? "Good luck". Not only will you employ different techniques, but you will be protecting different pieces and types of data and different types of data have different protection costs associated to them.<br />

### KPIs / Telemetry
