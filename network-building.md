# Network Building

## Geography

General idea about building the ideal network is coverage, coverage, coverage. What does coverage mean (American centric)? You're going to want access to legals, bonuses, kiosks, PPHs, offshores, etc. - i.e. ability to access as many markets as possible for pricing and liquidity reasons. Now, there will be a tradeoff for coverage with accessible bankroll/capital and ability to constantly churn over that bankroll, but, in a vacuum, more outs, more liquidity the better.<br /><br />

What exactly determines the geographical boundaries that you must occupy?
- Online Sportsbooks
- Brick & Mortar / Cash & Counter Locations
- Standalone Kiosks
- Geolocation and Governmental and Financial Restrictions

Therefore, the best approach is to identify exactly what the optimal location would be to find runners.
