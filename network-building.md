# Network Building

## Geography

General idea about building the ideal network is coverage, coverage, coverage. What does coverage mean (American centric)? You're going to want access to legals, bonuses, kiosks, PPHs, offshores, etc. - i.e. ability to access as many markets as possible for pricing and liquidity reasons. Now, there will be a tradeoff for coverage with accessible bankroll/capital and ability to constantly churn over that bankroll, but, in a vacuum, more outs, more liquidity the better.<br /><br />

What exactly determines the geographical boundaries that you must occupy?
- Online Sportsbooks
- Brick & Mortar / Cash & Counter Locations
- Standalone Kiosks
- Geolocation and Governmental and Financial Restrictions

Therefore, the best approach is to identify exactly what the optimal location would be to find runners.
- List of Online Sportsbooks - (to be published later)
- List of Brick & Mortar locations - n/a
- List of Cash & Counter locations -
    - https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/retailsportsbook - DK retail sportsbook locations
    - https://support.fanduel.com/s/article/Cash-at-Counter

Once you have a comprehensive idea of all the physical and digital locations you need access to successfully build out a full coverage network, you then need to tackle the following problems - 
- Staffing & Vetting
- Financing
- Reconciliation
- Communications
- OpSec
- KPIs / Telemetry

## Staffing & Vetting

Make no mistake - the sports betting landscape is a cesspool. Anyone who says different cannot be trusted to be able to give you an accurate interpretation about the world around them. A very common theme you hear in the sports betting world is the situation where someone gets stiffed and, only after they get stiffed, do they start to perform the required fact finding to try and ensure they get paid. Obviously, this is backwards and we want to build out our network and perform all vetting before anything distressing happens.
