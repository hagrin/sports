## So What Exactly is the Green Knight Test?

*"You get to swing at the Green Knight. But then the Green Knight gets to swing at you."*<br /><br />

In betting terms, you and your model get to bet into the market. Then, the market gets to bet into you and your model. The model gets the same vig the market gets (this point, not made clear in the article above, is articulated by Seth here - https://x.com/SethBurn/status/1825966428375363920 , archive link here - https://archive.is/HjvMo ).<br /><br />

The article linked above explains the entire concept perfectly. With normal prediction market performance tests of a model, you are basically just looking for market inefficiencies or edges. With the Greeen Knight Test, you put the market and your model on equal footing where you aren't simply looking for market inefficiencies, but you're trying to determine **"Can you generate better prices than the market?"**. As the article correctly states, the Green Knight Test gets even harder if you don't account for the existing market prices at all - i.e. no regressing to the market, no information gleaned from the market, etc.<br /><br />

The article also makes one extremely important statement that you should understand - you're **supposed** to fail the Green Knight Test. As the article states, the goal is to *fail it less* times. In the extremely rare instances that you do slay the Green Knight, it's a license to print money.
