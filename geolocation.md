# Geolocation Notes

This isn't a formal document, just typing down some notes that I want to explore even though I already have functional workarounds.

* Antidetect Browsers - had someone mention this to me, this seems like a non-starter and doesn't address many of the detection methods. Not sure it helps in any real manner, think people who bring this up are missing the larger detection vector. Can it help some and is it good privacy hygiene? Sure, but there's the larger issue of WiFi detection methods.

* PiKVM - some reports of better detection here in the most recent update (8 April 2025).
