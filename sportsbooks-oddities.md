# Sportsbook Oddities

Temporary file for certain things that I have noticed with the trading engines on certain sportsbooks.

## FanDuel

### Cashouts

* If you bet a ML that then goes in your favor to the point the ML is priced to unavailable, you cannot cashout (note - you wouldn't want to, but if you're someone with a limited bankroll, realize that your money will be locked in that ML bet until completion or the event starts going against your side to the point that ML gets lined again)

### Soccer

* All: No Asians
* Markets: Have live lines for Austrian Bundesliga, Norwegian Eliteserien, South Africa Premier, Swiss Super League (although not 100% coverage)
* Liga MX: No Tie No Bet / DNB markets
* MLS: Have found the Fanduel app game streams, when available to be 20+ seconds ahead of MLS Package stream through Apple
* Live Betting: Half time lines only post until the 44th minute
* Live Betting: Seems as if even if there is a lot of added time, live lines for some leagues will only post until 90+6
* USL: No USL markets
